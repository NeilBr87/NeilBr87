- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NeilBr87
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding my learning in all areas based on coding, web and software development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Pyton, CSS, Oracle, cyber security, ethical hacking and Javascript.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email address is neil.brooks87@gmail.com

I created this small repository as a portfolio to show to employers and potential collaborators on more basic projects. I'm an entry-level coder (as the programs contained will probably testify to!) but a reasonably fast learner.
